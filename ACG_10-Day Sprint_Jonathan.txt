Overview
	•	This Overview second contains a list of what everyone is responsible for at a high level.
	•	You’ll see a clean, short-term (next 10 days) task list by role.
	•	10-Day Feasibility: In case you were wondering about the feasibility of completing your task in 10-days, read this.
	•	If not, just skip to Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It. This contains:
Mission → Deliverables → How to build → Definition of Done → What ‘finished MVP’ looks like

1) Business / Logistics (Ops, systems, contracts, reporting)
	•	Stand up the operating system
	•	Finalize the end-to-end stage-gate SOP (stages, pass/fail rules, required outputs, SLAs, handoffs).
	•	Build the infrastructure
	•	Configure the CRM pipelines (Owners / Originators / Partners / Deals) with required fields, stages, and activity tracking.
	•	Set up a secure doc intake/upload workflow (even if simple: structured folders + naming standards).
	•	Formalize relationships
	•	Draft/complete the Originator Contractor Agreement + Program Rules (conduct, boundaries, non-circumvention, confidentiality).
	•	Draft/complete the Partner Intro Terms (success fee trigger at close, confidentiality, non-circumvention, dispute handling).
	•	Package Owner NDA / Mandate packet for consistent use.
	•	Make it measurable
	•	Create the weekly metrics snapshot (pipeline counts, stage conversions, next actions, originator activity, partner status).

2) Business / Real Estate (Screening discipline, deal standards, packaging)
	•	Define what qualifies
	•	Lock the Owner/Asset eligibility criteria (asset types, size bands, income/occupancy expectations, authority/objective requirements).
	•	Build the red-flag list + “fast fail” rules aligned to screening stages.
	•	Standardize what “partner-ready” means

3) Sales Management (Recruiting, coaching, cadence, performance)
	•	Build the originator channel
	•	Create a target list + outreach sequence and run a recruiting funnel (25–50 targets).
	•	Write the Originator Pitch (why join, how they’re supported, how they get paid, expectations).
	•	Operationalize execution
	•	Produce the Originator Field Pack: call openers, voicemail, email templates, objection handling, “next step” closes.
	•	Define the lead handling workflow (assignment rules, SLAs, recycle rules) and enforce it.
	•	Establish rhythm
	•	Launch the weekly cadence: pipeline huddle agenda + stalled-deal recovery process + KPI accountability.
	•	Pilot the system
	•	Onboard 2–3 pilot originators end-to-end to validate the workflow and refine scripts.

4) Communications (Collateral, messaging control, trust-building)
	•	Control the message
	•	Create the Master Messaging & Compliance-Safe Language Guide (approved phrases, phrases to avoid, disclaimers).
	•	Build the “kits”
	•	Produce the Owner Education Kit (plain-English explainer, process steps, timeline, FAQs).
	•	Produce the Originator Program One-Pager (what it is, who it’s for, benefits, expectations).
	•	Produce the Partner Onboarding/Intro Pack (ACG overview + how ACG screens/packages + intro protocol).
	•	Standardize outreach
	•	Draft and store email templates for: owner intro, NDA send, intake follow-up, partner intro, originator recruiting.
	•	Make it easy to distribute
	•	Package everything into a clean version-controlled folder structure (one “source of truth” kit set).
10-Day Feasibility
10 days is feasible for an “MVP operating system” (ready to run pilot originators + start partner/owner conversations) because a lot of the “heavy” artifacts already exist and mostly need packaging, tightening, and wiring into a workflow(e.g., Screening SOP, fee schedule, partner onboarding pack, owner mandate + NDA, originator comp framework, partner emails). 
Where 10 days becomes not feasible is if “complete” means production-grade + attorney-reviewed + fully automated + fully validated with market response. Some outcomes are inherently time-uncertain (partner replies, owner responsiveness, originator recruiting conversion).
What’s realistic to finish in 10 days (MVP definition)
Green (highly doable):
	•	Stage-gate SOP (you already have the 5-stage screening backbone; this is mainly tightening pass/fail, outputs, SLAs, handoffs). 
	•	Eligibility criteria + fast-fail rules + partner-ready minimum data (directly derived from existing SOP and onboarding materials). 
	•	Asset Brief template + “Typical Deal Path” one-pager (straightforward to draft from your deck + SOP + onboarding pack). 
	•	Owner education kit / FAQs (you already have an Owner Q&A that can be packaged into a clean kit). 
	•	Email templates (partner intro + follow-up already drafted; others can be patterned off these). 
	•	Weekly metrics snapshot (simple dashboard/report once CRM stages are defined).
Yellow (doable as MVP, but “final” depends on legal/tools):
	•	Originator Contractor Agreement + Program Rules: you can draft quickly, but “finalize” ideally includes counsel review.
	•	Partner Intro Terms: same—draftable fast, but legal polish may extend beyond 10 days.
	•	Master Messaging & Compliance-Safe Language Guide: you can create an internal “approved language + forbidden language + disclaimers” guide quickly, but true compliance sign-off is a legal function (especially if you’re operating across jurisdictions). Your existing “what we do / do not do” language is a strong base. 
	•	CRM + secure doc intake: feasible if you accept an “80/20” setup (pipelines + required fields + structured folder system). If you also want automation, integrations, and perfect data governance, that’s beyond 10 days.
Red (not fully controllable in 10 days):
	•	Recruiting funnel results (25–50 targets can be outreached; conversion to 2–3 onboarded originators depends on response rates).
	•	Pilot outcomes (you can start pilots and validate workflow, but getting clean cycle-time data + closed-loop learning typically takes longer than 10 days).
Critical-path dependencies (what must happen first)
	•	Stage-gate SOP + definitions (what “pass” means, required outputs at each stage). 
	•	CRM pipelines + required fields (so every activity has a home + reporting works).
	•	Doc intake + naming standards (so packaging doesn’t collapse into chaos).
	•	Owner mandate/NDA packet + partner intro terms (so you can safely move deals). 
	•	Originator boundaries + field pack (so originators don’t create regulatory/messaging risk). 
Bottom-line feasibility call
	•	If the goal is “ready to operate + run 2–3 originator pilots + begin selective partner/owner conversations”: Yes, feasible in 10 days, assuming focused execution and using the existing assets you already have. 
	•	If the goal is “fully institutionalized, legally finalized across jurisdictions, deeply automated, and validated with measurable recruiting/partner conversion”: Not feasible in 10 days—but you can still hit an MVP that’s operationally tight and de-risks the next 30–60 days.

Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It
Business / Real Estate (Screening discipline, deal standards, packaging)
Role Mission (10-day MVP)
By Day 10, Biz/RE makes ACG credible and consistent: every opportunity is screened the same way, fast-failed quickly when it should be, and packaged into a partner-ready brief that partners can act on without back-and-forth.
“Finished MVP” looks like this (vision)
	•	An originator submits an owner lead → Biz/RE can qualify or fast-fail in 15–30 minutes using a standard checklist.
	•	A “Pass” means something precise: the deal has the minimum data + docs and a clean story.
	•	A partner intro happens only when the deal is truly partner-ready: Asset Brief + Data Room + Deal Thesis + Clear asks are complete.
	•	Originators stay in their lane. Biz/RE protects quality and compliance by controlling what’s asked, promised, and interpreted.

MVP Deliverables (what this person must produce)
	•	Owner/Asset Eligibility Criteria (a one-page matrix + CRM checklist)
	•	Red Flags + Fast-Fail Rules (a one-page list aligned to stages)
	•	Partner-Ready Standard (minimum data/doc checklist + “missing items” rules)
	•	Asset Brief Template (2–3 pages) + Typical Deal Path One-Pager
	•	3 Example Profiles (Strong / Borderline / Reject) using the templates
	•	Conversation Boundary Guide (Originator-allowed vs ACG-only)

A) Define what qualifies
Lock the Owner/Asset eligibility criteria (asset types, size bands, income/occupancy expectations, authority/objective requirements)
Build Instructions (MVP)
Create a 1-page Eligibility Matrix with “Accept / Maybe / Reject” thresholds. Keep it simple enough to train originators, strict enough to protect partner time.
1) Asset Type Fit (set your MVP lane)
Define exactly which asset types are in-bounds for MVP. Example structure:
	•	In-Bounds (MVP focus): (e.g., multifamily, self-storage, industrial, retail centers, etc.)
	•	Conditional: (e.g., land, hospitality, special-use, development)
	•	Out-of-Bounds: (anything you are not packaging in MVP)
MVP rule: fewer asset types = faster screening discipline.
2) Size Bands (choose ranges partners actually care about)
Pick two bands:
	•	Sweet Spot: where you want most deals to land
	•	Minimum Floor: below which you generally don’t pursue (unless strategic)
You can express size as:
	•	Estimated value range (ballpark)
	•	NOI range
	•	Units / square footage
	•	Loan size (if relevant)
3) Performance Expectations (quick indicators)
Define minimum expectations for:
	•	Occupancy / utilization (if stabilized asset)
	•	Income documentation available (rent roll, T12/operating statement)
	•	Stability: how many months of consistent performance
4) Owner Requirements (authority + objective)
Define screening “must haves”:
	•	Authority: “Is the person we’re speaking to able to decide or sign?”
	•	Objective: clear intent (sell / refinance / recap / raise / restructure)
	•	Timeline: immediate / 30–90 / 90+
	•	Motivation clarity: why now?
5) Turn it into a CRM checklist
Your eligibility matrix must become:
	•	A checkbox/dropdown set in the Deal record
	•	A Pass/Fail field with reason codes
Expected Outcome (Definition of Done)
✅ One-page Eligibility Matrix that:
	•	States in-bounds asset types
	•	Has size bands (sweet spot + minimum floor)
	•	Defines minimum performance/documentation expectations
	•	Includes owner authority + objective requirements
	•	Can be used to decide: Pass / Park / Reject quickly
“Finished MVP” looks like
A new lead arrives and within 30 minutes Biz/RE can say:
	•	“This is in our MVP lane / not in our lane”
	•	“This is partner-viable / not partner-viable”
	•	“Here’s what’s missing to proceed”

Build the red-flag list + “fast fail” rules aligned to screening stages
Build Instructions (MVP)
Create a Fast-Fail Sheet with two categories:
Category 1: “Instant Reject” (no further work)
Examples of what typically belongs here:
	•	Owner can’t verify ownership or authority
	•	Refuses NDA but wants sensitive guidance/data
	•	Material inconsistencies in basic facts (address, ownership, asset type)
	•	Legal/ethical red flags (fraud indicators, unwillingness to provide basic proof)
	•	Asset type is out-of-bounds for MVP
Category 2: “Park Until Fixed”
Examples:
	•	Missing basic docs but owner is cooperative
	•	Timing too far out (e.g., 6–12 months)
	•	Financials unclear but can be clarified with T12/rent roll
	•	Cap stack complexity that requires partner consult later
Align to stages
Map fast-fails to where they occur:
	•	Pre-Screen fast-fails: identity, authority, asset in-bounds, basic objective, baseline data
	•	Screen/Validate fast-fails: inability to validate income/occupancy, title/ownership issues, critical missing docs, contradictory info
	•	Packaging fast-fails: owner won’t cooperate with packaging, refuses required disclosures, can’t produce core docs
Expected Outcome (Definition of Done)
✅ One-page red-flag list with:
	•	“Instant Reject” rules
	•	“Park until fixed” rules
	•	Stage mapping (where each fast-fail triggers)
	•	Reason codes that match the CRM (so reporting is clean)
“Finished MVP” looks like
Team stops wasting cycles:
	•	Bad deals get rejected politely fast
	•	“Maybe later” deals get parked with a clear re-entry trigger

B) Standardize what “partner-ready” means
Define the minimum required data/doc standard before partner introduction
Build Instructions (MVP)
Create a Partner-Ready Checklist with three layers:
Layer 1: Minimum Viable Data (no exceptions)
	•	Asset address + description
	•	Asset type + basic specs (units/SF, year built, condition notes)
	•	Ownership/entity name (or proof path)
	•	Owner objective + timeline
	•	High-level financial snapshot (NOI/revenue estimate range is fine if sourced)
	•	Known issues (vacancy, deferred maintenance, liens—if disclosed)
Layer 2: Minimum Viable Docs (target list)
For income-producing assets, MVP docs commonly include:
	•	Rent roll (or occupancy summary)
	•	Trailing 12 / operating statement (even if owner-generated initially)
	•	Tax bill / assessment (baseline)
	•	Photos / basic condition notes
	•	Entity/ownership verification (as available)
If a doc is missing, you need a rule:
	•	Either “partner-ready cannot proceed without it”
	•	Or “proceed if X substitute exists” (e.g., bank statements in lieu of T12)
Layer 3: Deal Story & Ask (required narrative)
Every partner intro must include:
	•	What the owner wants (one sentence)
	•	Why it makes sense (one paragraph)
	•	What ACG is asking the partner to do (clear action request)
	•	The “next step” call ask (15–30 min review call, etc.)
Expected Outcome (Definition of Done)
✅ A Partner-Ready Checklist that:
	•	Defines “minimum viable” data + docs
	•	Defines substitutes and exceptions
	•	Defines intro-ready narrative requirements
	•	Becomes a gating checklist inside CRM
“Finished MVP” looks like
Partners get intros that feel professional:
	•	Fewer follow-ups
	•	Faster “yes/no”
	•	More trust in ACG packaging discipline

Create the Asset Brief template (2–3 pages) and the “Typical Deal Path” expectations one-pager
Asset Brief Template (2–3 pages) — Build Instructions (MVP)
Design for speed and clarity. Target: 10–20 minutes to assemble once data exists.
Page 1: Executive Snapshot
	•	Deal ID + asset name/location
	•	Owner objective + timeline
	•	Asset overview (type, size, highlights)
	•	Financial headline numbers (revenue/NOI/occupancy; clearly labeled as “owner-provided” if so)
	•	ACG view: “why this is worth a look” (3 bullets)
	•	The ask: “What we want the partner to do next” (1–2 bullets)
Page 2: Asset & Performance Detail
	•	Unit/SF mix or tenant overview (as applicable)
	•	Occupancy trend (simple)
	•	Expenses snapshot (high-level)
	•	Capex/deferred maintenance notes
	•	Market context (2–4 bullets, no deep research needed in MVP)
Page 3 (optional): Risks + Process + Attachments
	•	Key risks / unknowns (bullet list)
	•	Open questions (what partner should evaluate)
	•	Data room contents list (what’s included)
	•	Contact protocol (who communicates with owner and how)
Typical Deal Path One-Pager — Build Instructions (MVP)
This is for owner alignment and partner clarity. Include:
	•	The stages (intake → pre-screen → validate → package → partner intro → partner process → close)
	•	Typical timeline ranges (best case / normal)
	•	What the owner must provide (docs + responsiveness expectations)
	•	What ACG does vs what the partner does
	•	Important disclaimers (plain-English)
Expected Outcome (Definition of Done)
✅ Two polished templates exist:
	•	Asset Brief (2–3 pages) in Doc/PDF format
	•	Typical Deal Path one-pager …and both are stored as the single source of truth for packaging.
“Finished MVP” looks like
Any team member can pick up the templates and produce consistent outputs that “look like ACG.”

C) Calibrate quality
Produce 3 example profiles: Strong / Borderline / Reject
Build Instructions (MVP)
Using the new templates, create 3 sample deal profiles (fictionalized is fine, or sanitized real patterns):
1) Strong Example
	•	Clean authority + clear objective
	•	Docs mostly available
	•	Metrics fall in the sweet spot
	•	Easy partner-ready story
2) Borderline Example
	•	Some missing docs, but cooperative owner
	•	Slightly outside sweet spot (size, occupancy, condition)
	•	Shows how to “Park until fixed” OR how to proceed with conditions
3) Reject Example
	•	Triggers fast-fail rules
	•	Demonstrates the polite rejection language + CRM coding
Each example must include:
	•	Eligibility matrix result
	•	Fast-fail / pass rationale
	•	Partner-ready checklist status
	•	Asset Brief (even if shorter)
Expected Outcome (Definition of Done)
✅ Three examples exist that:
	•	Teach the standards
	•	Make gray areas obvious
	•	Can be used to onboard originators + internal team
“Finished MVP” looks like
When someone argues “this seems fine,” you can point to examples and say:
	•	“This is Borderline; it needs X”
	•	“This is Reject because it triggers rule Y”

D) Set role boundaries
Write the Originator-allowed vs ACG-only conversation boundary guide
Build Instructions (MVP)
Create a 1–2 page boundary guide with two columns:
Originator Allowed (what they can gather)
	•	Basic owner info + best contact method
	•	Basic asset description (type, address, size/unit count)
	•	Owner objective + timeline (high-level)
	•	Whether docs exist (yes/no) and willingness to share under NDA
	•	Permission to send NDA + intro packet
	•	Scheduling a call with ACG
ACG-only (what originators must NOT do)
	•	Discuss pricing/fees in detail beyond approved language
	•	Make promises about outcomes, partners, timelines, or approvals
	•	Interpret financials, underwriting, valuation, token terms, securities-like language
	•	Negotiate terms
	•	Request sensitive documents without the approved intake process
	•	Communicate “partner names” prematurely or attempt direct partner coordination
Add “safe language” snippets
Include a few approved phrases originators can use:
	•	“ACG will review and confirm fit after NDA and basic intake.”
	•	“We don’t make commitments until the core team validates the package.”
	•	“We’ll introduce you to the right regulated partner if it qualifies.”
Expected Outcome (Definition of Done)
✅ Boundary guide exists and is enforced:
	•	Included in Originator Field Pack
	•	Signed acknowledgment (checkbox in CRM or as part of Program Rules)
“Finished MVP” looks like
Originators act as disciplined scouts, not closers:
	•	They gather just enough to qualify
	•	They protect the brand and keep ACG in control of partner-facing accuracy

Day 10 Acceptance Test for Role 2 (Biz/RE)
If all are “yes,” this role’s MVP is complete:
	•	Can we decide Pass/Park/Reject in <30 minutes using a standard matrix?
	•	Do we have written fast-fail rules and stage alignment?
	•	Do we have a partner-ready checklist that gates intros?
	•	Can we produce a clean 2–3 page Asset Brief within 1 hour once docs exist?
	•	Do we have Strong/Borderline/Reject examples for training?
	•	Do originators have a clear boundary guide with safe language?
