![ACG Logo](../Resources/ACG%20LOGO.png)

**Confidential - For Authorized Originators Only**

---

## Purpose
This guide establishes clear boundaries for Originator conversations with property owners. Our role is to qualify opportunities and introduce them to ACG for professional packaging and partner introductions. Originators act as disciplined scouts, not closers. This protects quality, compliance, and the ACG brand.

**Effective Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0

- Any form of commitment beyond introduction  

### Financial and Technical Analysis

- Securities-like language (returns, IRR, equity multiples)  

### Negotiation and Terms

## Safe Language Snippets

Use these approved phrases to stay within boundaries:

### General Process
- "ACG will review and confirm fit after NDA and basic intake."  
- "We don't make commitments until the core team validates the package."  
- "We'll introduce you to the right regulated partner if it qualifies."  

### Documentation
- "Under NDA, we'll need to review your rent roll and financials to prepare for partners."  
- "ACG handles all document coordination to ensure compliance."  

### Promises to Avoid
- ❌ "Our partners will definitely be interested."  
- ✅ "If it fits our criteria, we'll work to introduce qualified partners."  

- ❌ "You'll close within 60 days."  
- ✅ "Typical deals take 2-4 months from introduction to close."  

- ❌ "This is worth $5 million."  
- ✅ "ACG will help determine market value through proper channels."

## Training Examples

### Allowed Conversation
**Originator:** "Hi John, I'm calling about your property at 123 Main St. Can you tell me about your goals and timeline?"  

**Owner:** "I want to sell within the next year."  

**Originator:** "Great, and do you have financials available? We'd need those under NDA to evaluate fit."  

### Crossing Boundary (Not Allowed)
**Originator:** "Based on what you've described, this should be worth about $2 million. Our partners typically pay 7% cap rates."  

**Owner:** "That sounds good."  

**Originator:** "I'll connect you directly with our capital partner to discuss terms."  

*Training Note:* The second example crosses multiple boundaries: valuation interpretation, fee discussion, and direct partner coordination.
