## Screening Analysis (For Training)

### Eligibility Matrix Result
- **Asset Type Fit:** In-Bounds (Industrial)  
- **Size Band:** Below Minimum (75,000 SF - slightly under sweet spot of 100K+)  
- **Performance:** Below Expectations (7.5% cap, older systems)  
- **Owner Authority:** Verified  
- **Objective Clear:** Yes (Sell for retirement)  
- **Timeline Fit:** Borderline (12-18 months may be too long for some partners)  

### Fast-Fail Rationale
- No instant reject reasons apply  
- Park reasons: Missing basic docs (full rent roll), timing too far out (12-18 months), financials unclear (need tenant details)  
- Decision: **Watch** - Proceed with conditions or park until docs obtained  

### Partner-Ready Checklist Status
- ✅ Minimum Viable Data: Complete  
- ❌ Minimum Viable Docs: Missing full rent roll and tenant financials (owner cooperative but delayed)  
- ✅ Deal Story & Ask: Clear objective, good narrative, specific action request  

**Training Note:** This is an example of a "Borderline" profile. Shows how to handle cases with some gaps but cooperative owner. Could proceed with conditions or park until docs are provided. Demonstrates "Park until fixed" approach.
