## Screening Analysis (For Training)

### Eligibility Matrix Result
- **Asset Type Fit:** Out-of-Bounds (Hospitality not in MVP)  
- **Size Band:** Below Minimum (40 rooms too small)  
- **Performance:** Below Expectations (45% occupancy, distressed)  
- **Owner Authority:** Unverified (owner unable to provide proof)  
- **Objective Clear:** Yes (Sell due to distress)  
- **Timeline Fit:** No (distress signals red flags)  

### Fast-Fail Rationale
- Instant Reject: Asset type is out-of-bounds, owner can't verify ownership or authority, material inconsistencies in basic facts, legal/ethical red flags (distress/fraud indicators)  
- Decision: **Reject** - Multiple disqualifying factors  

### Partner-Ready Checklist Status
- ❌ Does not qualify for checklist - rejected at intake
